This project showcases a painting machine driven by an ATmega32 microcontroller, offering automated and precise painting operations. The machine employs two DC motorsâ€”one for vertical movements and another for horizontal movements. Safety is a paramount concern, and the machine is equipped with interrupt-triggered buttons that are automatically activated when the mechanism reaches the end of the track, ensuring the machine safely returns to its origin point without damaging the tracks.

Features:

Automated Painting: The ATmega32 microcontroller automates the painting process, enhancing efficiency and consistency.

Precise Movements: Dual DC motors enable accurate and controlled vertical and horizontal movements, ensuring detailed painting outputs.

Automatic Safety Mechanism: Interrupt-triggered buttons are automatically pushed when the mechanism reaches the end of the track, guaranteeing a safe return to the origin point without damaging the tracks.

Components Used:

1-ATmega32 Microcontroller

2-Two DC Motors

3-Interrupt-triggered Buttons

4-Motor Drivers

5-Power Supply Unit

6-Painting Mechanism

How to Use:

1-Connect the power supply unit to the microcontroller and the motor drivers.

2-Load the painting mechanism with the desired paint and securely attach it to the machine.

3-Place the painting machine at the desired starting position on the canvas.

4-The painting machine will autonomously create the painting, efficiently maneuvering through precise movements along the way.

5-The interrupt-triggered buttons will automatically engage when the mechanism reaches the end of the track, ensuring a safe return to the origin point without damaging the tracks.
