This project showcases a painting machine driven by an ATmega32 microcontroller, offering automated and precise painting operations. The machine employs two DC motorsâ€”one for vertical movements and another for horizontal movements. Safety is a paramount concern, and the machine is equipped with interrupt-triggered buttons that are automatically activated when the mechanism reaches the end of the track, ensuring the machine safely returns to its origin point without damaging the tracks.

Features
Automated Painting: The ATmega32 microcontroller automates the painting process, enhancing efficiency and consistency.

Precise Movements: Dual DC motors enable accurate and controlled vertical and horizontal movements, ensuring detailed painting outputs.

Automatic Safety Mechanism: Interrupt-triggered buttons are automatically pushed when the mechanism reaches the end of the track, guaranteeing a safe return to the origin point without damaging the tracks.

Components Used
ATmega32 Microcontroller
Two DC Motors
Interrupt-triggered Buttons
Motor Drivers

Painting Mechanism
How to Use
Connect the power supply unit to the microcontroller and the motor drivers.
Load the painting mechanism with the desired paint and securely attach it to the machine.
Place the painting machine at the desired starting position on the canvas.
The painting machine will autonomously create the painting, efficiently maneuvering through precise movements along the way.
The interrupt-triggered buttons will automatically engage when the mechanism reaches the end of the track, ensuring a safe return to the origin point without damaging the tracks.
